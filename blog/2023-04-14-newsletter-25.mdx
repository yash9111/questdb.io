## üèÜ QuestDB 7.1.1

We have released QuestDB 7.1.1 following thousands of hours of fuzz testing. The
highlights for the release include:

- Optimized WAL storage mechanism.
- Improved Web Console UI.
- [SHOW PARTITIONS](/docs/reference/sql/show/) SQL and
  [table_partitions](/docs/reference/function/meta/#table_partitions) function
  for partition details.
- Stability improvements in the SQL engine, CSV import, and Web Console UI.
- QuestDB 7.1 introduced a
  [UI library dependency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)
  that is not yet readily available to all users. QuestDB 7.1.1 removes this
  dependency.

This release also includes pull requests from our community. Kudos to
[@SiyaoIsHiding](https://github.com/SiyaoIsHiding) and
[@winne42](https://github.com/winne42) for the code contributions! üëè
