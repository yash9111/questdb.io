As someone interested in the future of DeFi
([decentralized finance](https://yitaek.medium.com/intro-to-defi-b4ab2ec0f156)),
I wanted to better track the price of different cryptocurrencies and store them
into a timeseries database for further analysis. I found an interesting talk by
Ludvig Sandman and Bruce Zulu at Kafka Summit London 2019,
[Using Kafka Streams to Analyze Live Trading Activity for Crypto Exchanges](https://www.confluent.io/kafka-summit-lon19/using-kafka-streams-analyze-trading-crypto-exchanges/),
so I decided to leverage Kafka and modify it for my own use.

QuestDB is a fast, open-source, timeseries database with SQL support. This makes
it a great candidate to store financial market data for further historical trend
analysis and generating trade signals. The team has released an official
[QuestDB Kafka connector](/docs/third-party-tools/kafka/questdb-kafka/).
Underneath the hood, the new connector uses InfluxDB line protocol (ILP), which
has excellent ingestion performance and easy schema management. So I decided to
give this a spin and apply it to my project,
[kafka-crypto-questdb](https://github.com/Yitaek/kafka-crypto-questdb).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with at least 4GB memory
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
  [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yitaek/kafka-crypto-questdb) which
  contains the source for the examples below

**Note:** Memory can be increased on Docker Desktop in **Settings -> Resources
-> Memory** and increasing the default limit from `2GB` to `4GB`.

## Project setup

At a high level, this project polls the public Coinbase API for the price of
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink. This information was then published onto
individual topics on Kafka (e.g. topic_BTC) and sent to QuestDb via Kafka
Connect:

![Overview from coinbase to QuestDB via Kafka](/img/blog/2023-01-12/overview.png)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yitaek/kafka-crypto-questdb.git
```

The codebase is organized into three parts:

- **docker**: Dockerfile to set up the Kafka Connector

- **docker-compose**: holds docker-compose file to start Kafka (zookeeper,
  broker, kafka connect), QuestDB, and JSON file to initialize Kafka Connect

- **Python files**: grabs latest pricing information from Coinbase and publishes
  information to Kafka

### Docker

First, I installed the
[QuestDB Kafka Connector files](https://github.com/Yitaek/kafka-crypto-questdb/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile):

```
 FROM alpine:latest AS builder
 RUN wget https://github.com/questdb/kafka-questdb-connector/releases/download/v0.4/kafka-questdb-connector-0.4-bin.zip && \
     unzip kafka-questdb-connector-*-bin.zip
 FROM confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect:7.3.0
 COPY --from=builder /kafka-questdb-connector/*.jar /usr/share/java/kafka/
```

The above Dockerfile simply downloads the binaries for the connector and copies
the JAR files to the location Kafka Connect expects.

### Run docker-compose

Next, the
[docker compose file](https://github.com/Yitaek/kafka-crypto-questdb/blob/main/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml)
exposes port 9009 (ILP) on QuestDB instead of 8812 (PostgreSQL):

```
questdb:
  image: questdb/questdb:6.6.1
  hostname: questdb
  container_name: questdb
  ports:
    - "9000:9000"
    - "9009:9009"
```

At this point, we have all the necessary components for the demo so started the
stack via docker compose:

```shell
$ cd docker-compose
$ docker compose up
```

The docker-compose file runs the following services:

- QuestDB
- [Zookeeper](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER) for Kafka
  config information, distributed sync, and group services
- [Kafka Broker](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#intro_nutshell) for
  receiving and storing messages and for consumers to fetch messages by topic
- [Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) with the
  QuestDB Kafka Connector

### Query the data with Python files

To finish the setup, I first created the Kafka Connect sink:

```shell title="From ./docker-compose directory"
$ curl -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data @questdb-sink-btc.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

The curl command above submitted a JSON file which contains the configuration
for the QuestDB Kafka Connector:

```json
{
  "name": "questdb-sink-btc",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.questdb.kafka.QuestDBSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "topics": "topic_BTC",
    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
    "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
    "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
    "host": "questdb",
    "timestamp.field.name": "timestamp",
    "symbols":" currency"
  }
}
```

The important things to notice here are:

- `value.converter.schemas.enable`: since there is no schema in messages and we
  do not use Schema Registry either, we have to set this value to `false`.

- `timestamp.field.name`: the connector supports
  [designated timestamps](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp/) either in integer
  or timestamp format. For integers, units will be autodetected as long as the
  field name is configured.

For a full list of configuration options, refer to the
[configuration manual](/docs/third-party-tools/kafka/questdb-kafka/#configuration-manual).

Then I started a Python script polling for the latest prices:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python getData.py
```

Navigating to the console UI at `localhost:9000`, we can see the prices of
Bitcoin being ingested:

![Screenshot of the result](/img/blog/2023-01-12/bitcoin.png)

You can repeat this process for the other topics as well. If you prefer to run
without a UI, you can also use the REST API to check:

```bash
curl -G \
--data-urlencode "query=select * from topic_BTC" \
http://localhost:9000/exp
```

## Visualize the data

The QuestDB console UI also provides the ability to generate basic graphs:

1. Click on the **Chart** tab underneath the Tables
2. Select `line` as the chart type, `timestamp` as the label
3. Click **Draw**

![Screenshot of the line chart](/img/blog/2023-01-12/visualization.png)

The QuestDB native charting capabilities are limited to a few graph types, so
for more advanced visualization, check out
[Time-Series Monitoring Dashboard with Grafana and QuestDB](/blog/time-series-monitoring-dashboard-grafana-questdb/).

## Wrapping up

To stop streaming data, simply stop the Python scripts. To stop and remove the
Kafka cluster / QuestDB services, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

The overview page for the
[QuestDB Kafka connector on the QuestDB website](/docs/third-party-tools/kafka/questdb-kafka/)
lists more information on the configuration details and FAQs. The
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/questdb/kafka-questdb-connector/tree/main/kafka-questdb-connector-samples)
for the connector also has sample projects including a Node.js and a Java
example for those looking to leverage a reference architecture.
