Donald Knuth [famously wrote](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/356635.356640) that
Premature Optimization is the root of all evil. I, for one, believe that all
evil comes from spuriously failing builds. Nothing steals my confidence in a
project as quickly as unstable builds alternating between green and red for no reason.
This is a story about unstable builds and troubleshooting. More importantly,
this story is written to thank all contributors to basic software
infrastructure - the infrastructure we all use and take for granted.

## Surprise in logs

Upon logging into
[Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/devops/pipelines/)
to review the logs of multiple failed builds, I mentally braced myself for a
potentially arduous troubleshooting session. I suspected that a race condition
was the culprit that caused non-deterministic outcomes. Therefore, I was
surprised to discover the actual reasons for the recent build failures. They
were all similar to this:

```
2023-02-22T13:57:55.6111290Z [ERROR] Plugin org.apache. Maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:3.2.0 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Failed to read artifact descriptor for org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:jar:3.2.0: Could not transfer artifact org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:pom:3.2.0 from/to central (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2): Connection reset -> [Help 1]

```

This was the most interesting part:
`Could not transfer artifact org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:pom:3.2.0 from/to central (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2): Connection reset -> [Help 1]`

The error comes from the
[Apache Maven project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven), which we use
to build QuestDB. Maven complained that it could not download the Maven Clean
plugin from the Central repository. If this had just been a one-off error, I
would have played it down as a network hiccup. However, we were getting the same
error multiple times a day!

## The investigation, part I

I am no Maven expert, so I did what every developer would do when
troubleshooting a rather complex piece of technology: I Googled it!

![A picture of Yoda saying: "Use Google, You Must. Easy, it is. Answer, it shall provide.](/img/blog/2023-03-01/yoda.jpg)

Eventually, I stumbled upon
[this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WAGON-545).

It says that Azure Pipelines kill idle connections, which does not play nicely
with the habit of Maven to pool and re-use HTTP connections. This is consistent
with what I saw in builds logs: Maven started tests, which ran for 20+ minutes
and passed successfully. Then Maven wanted to download the Clean Plugin to do
something else, but the download attempt failed, which killed the whole build.

There was still one question left unanswered: Why did we start getting this
error only recently? Well, I had an explanation for this, too: We kept adding
tests, so they ran longer. Azure Pipelines killed connections because the total
test duration exceeded the idle connection timeout. It all started to make sense.

I also found a Maven configuration property to restrict the Time-To-Live of
connections in the pool. The Maven issue I found says:

"Azure users shall set the TTL to 240 seconds or less."

So I [sent a Pull Request](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3012) to set
TTL to 30s, announced it in the company Slack, and felt good about myself :)

![A screenshot from Slack where I say: the Maven connection reset issues should be fixed for all new PR builds. Let me know if you experience it again.](/img/blog/2023-03-01/slack1.png)

It took less than 30 minutes, and we got another failure:
![A screenshot from Slack where my colleague says: It didn't help](/img/blog/2023-03-01/slack2.png)

The failure had the same cause as before. The fix did not work. Back to square
one.

## The investigation, part II

Googling blindly combined with a bit of logical reasoning failed to produce
results. There was only one answer: **WE NEED MOAR LOGS!** Running Maven with
verbose logs produced an exception with this beautiful stack trace:

```

It looks like a typical lengthy Java stack trace. I noticed that that there was
nothing about "Wagon". I knew [Wagon](https://maven.apache.org/wagon/) was a
Maven component to download dependencies. Even my first fix attempt
[configured a Wagon-related property](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3012/files#diff-1494e9436657033af9f4bc2367589b709b4ecc2cf467a525bb99feef983f87baR21):
`-Dmaven.wagon.httpconnectionManager.ttlSeconds=30`

So it was suspicious that I could not see anything Wagon-related in the
exception stack trace. At this point, I resorted to the 3rd level of
troubleshooting: Reading the source code! The Maven project consists of many
components; for a non-expert, it's not simple to grasp. Eventually, I made an
interesting discovery: Maven dependency resolver supports pluggable (network)
transports. Digging deeper, I found 2 Transport implementations that can provide
HTTP access:

1. The Wagon implementation I knew about
2. A new “Native” implementation

The [Wagon implementation](https://github.com/apache/maven-wagon/blob/88e8574c69d83e6a658fcd2ad10f3f80926b8840/wagon-providers/wagon-http-shared/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/wagon/shared/http/AbstractHttpClientWagon.java#L560)
uses the Apache HTTP Client internally, and it configures the client with a
retry handler. There are different retry strategies available. What is important
is that the Wagon transport uses three retries by default:

```java
private static CloseableHttpClient createClient()
    {
        return HttpClientBuilder.create() //
            .useSystemProperties() //
            .disableConnectionState() //
            .setConnectionManager( httpClientConnectionManager ) //
            .setRetryHandler( createRetryHandler() )
            .setServiceUnavailableRetryStrategy( createServiceUnavailableRetryStrategy() )
            .setDefaultAuthSchemeRegistry( createAuthSchemeRegistry() )
            .setRedirectStrategy( new WagonRedirectStrategy() )
            .build();
    }
[...]

private static HttpRequestRetryHandler createRetryHandler()
  {
      switch ( RETRY_HANDLER_CLASS )
      {
          case "default":
              if ( StringUtils.isEmpty( RETRY_HANDLER_EXCEPTIONS ) )
              {
                  return new DefaultHttpRequestRetryHandler(
                          RETRY_HANDLER_COUNT, RETRY_HANDLER_REQUEST_SENT_ENABLED );
              }
              return new DefaultHttpRequestRetryHandler(
                      RETRY_HANDLER_COUNT, RETRY_HANDLER_REQUEST_SENT_ENABLED, getNonRetryableExceptions() )
              {
              };
          case "standard":
              return new StandardHttpRequestRetryHandler( RETRY_HANDLER_COUNT, RETRY_HANDLER_REQUEST_SENT_ENABLED );
          default:
              try
              {
                  final ClassLoader classLoader = AbstractHttpClientWagon.class.getClassLoader();
                  return HttpRequestRetryHandler.class.cast( classLoader.loadClass( RETRY_HANDLER_CLASS )
                                                                        .getConstructor().newInstance() );
              }
              catch ( final Exception e )
              {
                  throw new IllegalArgumentException( e );
              }
      }
  }
```

The source code of the
[“Native” transport implementation](https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver/blob/97dfd1c2b9deb15734d5e401807e55cd0498332a/maven-resolver-transport-http/src/main/java/org/eclipse/aether/transport/http/HttpTransporter.java#L190-L200)
is directly in the Maven Resolver project. Judging from the class and package names, it is
clear that this is the transport I saw in the exception stack traces on the
build server. It also uses the Apache HTTP Client internally but does not
configure any retrying strategy!

```java
this.client = HttpClientBuilder.create()
        .setUserAgent(userAgent)
        .setDefaultSocketConfig(socketConfig)
        .setDefaultRequestConfig(requestConfig)
        .setDefaultAuthSchemeRegistry(authSchemeRegistry)
        .setConnectionManager(state.getConnectionManager())
        .setConnectionManagerShared(true)
        .setDefaultCredentialsProvider(toCredentialsProvider(server, repoAuthContext, proxy, proxyAuthContext))
        .setProxy(proxy)
        .build();
```

It appears that Maven is failing quickly instead of attempting to retry when a
connection is terminated because the Native transport protocol does not attempt
to retry and immediately reports network errors. However, why did this issue
appear only recently? I opened
[Maven 3.9 release notes](https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.0/release-notes.html#potentially-breaking-core-changes)
once again. The paragraph _“Potentially Breaking Core Changes”_ did not have
anything suspicious. Luckily, I kept reading and saw this: _“Switchable and
alternative resolver transports included, with default switched to native
transport.”_ Bingo! This must be it.

Here was my hypothesis: We invoked Maven via the
[Azure Pipelines Maven Task](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/MavenV3)
and we did not
[specify Maven version explicitly](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/abbab65949fc8ee2c036a841b789bd99d3057310/ci/templates/steps.yml#L26).
Hence, it used the default version, which was recently upgraded to Maven 3.9.
From the release notes, we learned that Maven 3.9 switched to the new Native
transport that does not support retrying. It all started to make sense.

How to test this hypothesis? There were two options:

1. Downgrade Maven to version pre-3.9
2. Force Maven 3.9 to use the Wagon transport instead of the new Native
   transport

While browsing Maven source code, I stumbled upon a
[strategy for selecting transports:](https://github.com/apache/maven/blob/e9d570889ffce29c3f92494510499ae0e32a02cf/maven-core/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/internal/aether/DefaultRepositorySystemSessionFactory.java#L327-L341)

```java
private static final String MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_KEY = "maven.resolver.transport";
private static final String MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_DEFAULT = "default";
private static final String MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_WAGON = "wagon";
private static final String MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_NATIVE = "native";
private static final String MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_AUTO = "auto";
[...]

Object transport = configProps.getOrDefault(MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_KEY, MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_DEFAULT);
        if (MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_DEFAULT.equals(transport)) {
            // The "default" mode (user did not set anything) from now on defaults to AUTO

            // Make sure (whatever extra priority is set) that resolver native is selected
            configProps.put(NATIVE_FILE_TRANSPORTER_PRIORITY_KEY, RESOLVER_MAX_PRIORITY);

        } else if (!MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_AUTO.equals(transport)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown resolver transport '" + transport
                    + "'. Supported transports are: " + MAVEN_RESOLVER_TRANSPORT_WAGON + ", "

I figured out that forcing the old Wagon transport was as simple as passing
`-Dmaven.resolver.transport=wagon` to my build command. I
[added the flag](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3014/commits/5f097649fab2716032cd686c6bd586479bf088b1)
and waited eagerly for the build results. And it was a success! The first build
passed, then the second, third, and fourth. All builds were green! Such a relief.
Our precious builds were deterministic again. Problem Solved! Or not?

## Contributing Back

We all consume open source. Apache Maven itself is open source. It’s so
ubiquitous that it is impossible to find a Java developer who has never used it.
Maven is a basic software infrastructure that we all take for granted. It’s not
backed by a large corporation or by a VC-funded startup. Volunteers maintain it.
I felt the least I could do was to report my experience to the Maven team, so
they could clarify whether it was an intentional behavior or a bug. I
[opened a ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7708) and wanted to
move on.

The same evening, I saw one of the Maven maintainers create a
[new issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MRESOLVER-326) in the Maven
Resolver project and link it to the Maven issue I created earlier. I took it as
a confirmation that the behavior was not intentional and started to poke the
Maven Resolver source code once again. Only this time with the intention to fix
it.

It turned out that the fix was really easy. It was a matter of
[creating a retry handler and setting the desired retry count](https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver/pull/253/files#diff-cb82a28d1938522d3e73b0df9a33bf6f80fdb854296bb2020f86fad9c139d22d).
That was exactly what the old Wagon plugin was doing. A few lines got changed.
Then I was wondering how to test it. None of the
[existing Resolver tests](https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver/blob/97dfd1c2b9deb15734d5e401807e55cd0498332a/maven-resolver-transport-http/src/test/java/org/eclipse/aether/transport/http/HttpTransporterTest.java#L62)
exercises scenarios where a connection to a remote repository fails. The
existing tests use a
[Jetty-based server](https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver/blob/97dfd1c2b9deb15734d5e401807e55cd0498332a/maven-resolver-transport-http/src/test/java/org/eclipse/aether/transport/http/HttpServer.java)
mimicking a remote repository. So I figured out I could add a fault injection: A
Jetty handler which force-closes a predefined number of connections. And then
test if the resolver can still access the server. Again,
[a few lines of code](https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver/pull/253/files#diff-774033f5c0b952273dd7ab169d053c8038e1074565ff6e99e3345e8a23e033d2R198-R241):

```java
private class ConnectionClosingHandler extends AbstractHandler {
    public void handle(String target, Request req, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (connectionsToClose.getAndDecrement() > 0) {
            Response jettyResponse = (Response) response;
            jettyResponse.getHttpChannel().getConnection().close();
        }
    }
}
```

This infrastructure allowed me to write tests similar to this:

```java
@Test
public void testRetryHandler_defaultCount_positive() throws Exception {
  httpServer.setConnectionsToClose(3);
  transporter.peek(new PeekTask(URI.create("repo/file.txt")));
}
```

Easy-peasy!

I sent the [Pull Request](https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver/pull/253) and
was ready to forget about it. Merging a PR to new projects can take a while. To
my surprise, the maintainers reviewed the PR less than 1 hour after the
submission and merged it the next morning. Wow! This is the way to attract new
contributors! I admire all people maintaining projects like Maven. They do it in
their free time, and I reckon they mostly hear from users when something is
wrong and when users are upset. They deserve recognition for what they do.
[Tamas Cservenak](https://twitter.com/cstamas) and
[Slawomir Jaranowski](https://twitter.com/SlawekJaran) helped me with the PR. If
you are reading this: Thank you!

What is the moral of the story?

1. Troubleshooting is fun.
2. Read release notes carefully.
3. Be grateful to the maintainers of basic infrastructure.
4. Contributing back feels good!
