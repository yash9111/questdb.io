In this tutorial, we will cover how to load demo data from .CSV files into
QuestDB and to use this as a data source for a Grafana dashboard. The dashboard
will have line charts as data visualizations that make use of aggregate SQL
functions and Grafana global variables for sampling data based on dashboard
settings.

## What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source visualization and dashboard tool for any type of data.
It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no
matter where they are stored. With its powerful query language, you can quickly
analyze complex data sets and create dynamic dashboards to monitor your
applications and infrastructure. Grafana also provides an ever-growing library
of plugins for data sources, panel types, and visualizations.

Grafana consists of a server that connects to one or more data sources to
retrieve data, which the user then visualizes from their browser.

The following three Grafana features will be used in this tutorial:

1. **Data source** - this is how you tell Grafana where your data is stored and
   how you want to access it. For this tutorial, we will have a QuestDB server
   running which we will access via Postgres Wire using the PostgreSQL data
   source plugin.
2. **Dashboard** - A group of widgets that are displayed together on the same
   screen.
3. **Panel** - A single visualization which can be a graph or table.

## Setup

### Start Grafana

Start Grafana using `docker run` with the `--add-host` parameter:

```shell
docker run --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
-p 3000:3000 --name=grafana \
-v grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana \
grafana/grafana-oss
```

Once the Grafana server has started, you can access it via port 3000
(`http://localhost:3000`). The default login credentials are as follows:

```shell
user:admin
password:admin
```

### Start QuestDB

The Docker version for QuestDB can be run by exposing the port `8812` for the
PostgreSQL connection and port `9000` for the web and REST interface. Similar to
the Grafana container, we add the `--add-host` parameter:

```shell
docker run --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
-p 9000:9000 -p 9009:9009 -p 8812:8812 -p 9003:9003 \
-v "$(pwd):/var/lib/questdb" \
-e QDB_PG_READONLY_USER_ENABLED=true \
questdb/questdb:latest

```

### Loading the dataset

On our [live demo]({@demoUrl@}), uses 10+ years of taxi data. For this tutorial,
we have a subset of that data, the data for the whole of February 2018. You can
download the compressed dataset
[from Amazon S3](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/questdb.io/datasets/grafana_tutorial_dataset.tar.gz):

```shell
curl https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/questdb.io/datasets/grafana_tutorial_dataset.tar.gz > grafana_data.tar.gz
tar -xvf grafana_data.tar.gz
```

There should be two datasets available as `.CSV` files:

- `weather.csv`
- `taxi_trips_feb_2018.csv`

These can be imported via curl using the `/imp` REST entrypoint:

```shell
curl -F data=@taxi_trips_feb_2018.csv http://localhost:9000/imp
curl -F data=@weather.csv http://localhost:9000/imp
```

## Creating your first visualization

### Create a data source

In Grafana, select to the cog icon to expand the **Configuration** menu, select
**Data Sources** and click the **Add data source** button. Choose PostgreSQL
plugin and configure it with the following settings:

```
host:host.docker.internal:8812
database:qdb
user:user
password:quest
TLS/SSL mode:disable
```

<Screenshot
  alt="Screenshot of configuring data source"
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/data-source.png"
/>

Note that by default, Grafana does not validate that queries are read-only. This
means it's possible to run queries such as `drop table x` in Grafana which would
be destructive to a dataset.

To protect against this, we have set the environment variable
`QDB_PG_READONLY_USER_ENABLED` to true when starting the QuestDB container. Once
this configuration is set, we enable a read-only user, and we could use the
default user (`pg.readonly.user` = user) and password (`pg.readonly.password` =
quest) to log in. More details for setting this configuration can be found on
QuestDB's [Docker configuration page](/docs/reference/configuration/#docker).

To avoid unnecessary memory usage, it is also recommended to disable SELECT
query cache by setting the environment variable `PG_SELECT_CACHE_ENABLED` to
false. That's because we are only using Grafana for our queries: Grafana does
not use prepared statements when sending the queries and the query cache becomes
much less efficient. Of course, if you are using other tools on top of this
setup, you will need to evaluate the suitable settings.

### Create a dashboard and a panel

Now that we have a data source and a dashboard, we can add a panel. Navigate to
**+ Create** and select **Dashboard**:

import Screenshot from "@theme/Screenshot"

<Screenshot
  alt="Screenshot of a new dashboard with a 'Add new panel' button"
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/add-new-panel.png"
/>

The new panel has a graphing area on the top half of the window and a query
builder in the bottom half:

<Screenshot
  alt="Screenshot of a blank panel after being created"
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/blank-panel.png"
/>

Toggle the query editor to **text edit mode** by clicking the pencil icon or by
clicking the **Edit SQL** button. The query editor will now accept SQL
statements that we can input directly:

<Screenshot
  alt="Screenshot showing how to toggle text edit mode"
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/toggle-text-edit.png"
/>

Paste the following query into the editor:

```
SELECT pickup_datetime AS time,
       avg(trip_distance) AS distance
FROM ('taxi_trips_feb_2018.csv' timestamp(pickup_datetime))
WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)
SAMPLE BY $__interval;
```

Click the time range selector above the chart and set the following date range:

- Set the **From** value to `2018-02-07 00:00:00`
- Set the **To** value to `2018-02-14 23:59:59` and click **Apply time range**

We have built our first panel with aggregations:

<Screenshot
  alt="A panel showing the average distance traveled, filtered by taxi type and with dynamic sampling."
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/first-panel.png"
/>

#### Query details

To build a time-series dashboard in Grafana, the results need to be sorted by
time. In QuestDB, we typically don't need to do anything as results tend to be
sorted already. Check out Grafana
[time-series queries](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/postgres/#time-series-queries)
for more information.

To graph the average trip distance above, we use the `avg()` function on the
`trip_distance` column. This function aggregates data over the specified
sampling interval. If the sampling interval is **1-hour**, we are calculating
the average distance traveled during each 1-hour interval. You can find more
information on QuestDB
[aggregate functions on our documentation](/docs/reference/function/aggregation).

There are also 2 key Grafana-specific expressions used which can be identified
by the `$__` prefix:

`$__interval` This is a dynamic interval based on the time range applied to the
dashboard. By using this function, the sampling interval changes automatically
as the user zooms in and out of the panel.

`$__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)` tells Grafana to send the start-time and
end-time defined in the dashboard to the QuestDB server. Given the settings we
have configured so far with our date range, Grafana translates this to the
following:

```
pickupDatetime BETWEEN '2018-02-01T00:00:00Z' AND '2018-02-28T23:59:59Z'
```

These are **global variables** which can be used in queries and elsewhere in
panels and dashboards. To learn more about the use of these variables, refer to
the
[Grafana reference documentation on Global variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/variable-types/global-variables/#global-variables).

Finally, we use alias such as `SELECT pickup_datetime AS time` in all the
queries. This is because the PostgreSQL Grafana plugin expects a column named
"time" for any time-series chart. We use an alias to do so here, and you can
also use the special \$\_\_time() macro, as in:

```sql
SELECT
$__time(pickup_datetime),
avg(trip_distance) AS distance
FROM ('taxi_trips_feb_2018.csv' timestamp(pickup_datetime))
WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)
SAMPLE BY $__interval;
```

### Adding multiple queries

You can add multiple queries to the same panel which will display multiple lines
on a graph. To demonstrate this, separate the taxi data into two series, one for
cash payments and one for card payments. The first query will have a default
name of `A`

```
--Cash
SELECT pickup_datetime AS time,
       avg(trip_distance) AS cash
FROM ('taxi_trips_feb_2018.csv' timestamp(pickup_datetime))
WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)
AND payment_type IN ('Cash')
SAMPLE BY $__interval;
```

Click **+ Query** to add a second query (automatically labeled `B`) and paste
the following in text mode:

```
--Card
SELECT pickup_datetime AS time,
       avg(trip_distance) AS card
FROM ('taxi_trips_feb_2018.csv' timestamp(pickup_datetime))
WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)
AND payment_type IN ('Card')
SAMPLE BY $__interval;
```

Both queries are now layered on the same panel with a green line for cash and a
yellow line for card payments:

<Screenshot
  alt="A panel showing the average distance travelled, filtered by taxi type and with dynamic sampling."
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/panel-filtering-by-taxi-type.png"
/>

We can see in this graph that the distance traveled by those paying with cards
is longer than for those paying with cash. This could be due to the fact that
users usually carry less cash than the balance in their card.

Let’s add another panel by selecting **Dashboards** and **+ New dashboard**:

<Screenshot
  alt="A screenshot showing the add new dashboard option."
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/add-new-dashboard.png"
/>

This time, we will add the following query:

```
SELECT
pickup_datetime AS "time",
count()
FROM ('taxi_trips_feb_2018.csv' timestamp(pickup_datetime))
WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)
SAMPLE BY $__interval;
```

This is what our query looks like when viewing a time range of 28 days:

<Screenshot
  alt="A panel showing the number of trips over a month using dynamic sampling."
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/panel-count-of-taxi-trips-in-whole-month.png"
/>

Zooming in to a single day shows more detailed data points as we are sampling by
Grafana's `$__interval` property:

<Screenshot
  alt="A panel showing the number of trips in a day using dynamic sampling."
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/panel-count-of-taxi-trips-in-a-day.png"
/>

The daily cycle of activity is visible, with rides peaking in the early evening
and reaching a low in the middle of the night.

## ASOF JOIN

`ASOF JOIN` allows us to join 2 tables based on timestamps that do not exactly
match. To join the taxi trips data with weather data, enter the following query:

```
SELECT
    pickup_datetime as "time",
    avg(fare_amount) as fare_amount,
    avg(rain1H) as rain1H
FROM (('taxi_trips_feb_2018.csv' timestamp(pickup_datetime)) WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime))
ASOF JOIN (weather.csv timestamp(timestamp))
SAMPLE BY $__interval;
```

To view a selected week in February 2018, select the time range picker above the
chart:

- Set the **From** value to `2018-02-07 00:00:00`
- Set the **To** value to `2018-02-14 23:59:59` and click **Apply time range**
- Enable dual Y-axis in the option panel by using **Overrides**, simply
  assigning different axis placements and units for fields `fare_amount` and
  `rain1H`.

<Screenshot
  alt="Assign different placement and units respectively for average fare amount and hourly precipitation."
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-12/enable-2nd-y-axis.png"
/>

In this graph, we have 2 series, in green we have the fare amount sampled
dynamically, and in yellow we have the average precipitation per hour in
millimeters. From the graph, it’s hard to say whether there is a correlation
between rain and the amount spent on taxi rides.

/>

## Conclusion

We have learned how to import time series data into QuestDB and build a
dashboard with multiple queries in Grafana. We can use this dashboard to explore
the relationship between taxi fares and rainfall, if any. With a dual Y-axis, we
can easily compare the two datasets and identify any correlations. Data analysis
with a visualization like this can be extremely useful, as it can provide
insights into how weather conditions and taxi fares affect each other.
