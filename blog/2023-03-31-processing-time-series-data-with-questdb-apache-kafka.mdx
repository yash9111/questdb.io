## Introduction: Choosing Apache Kafka and QuestDB to stream time-series data


Apache Kafka is a battle-tested distributed stream-processing platform popular
in the financial industry to handle mission-critical transactional workloads.
Kafka's ability to handle large volumes of real-time market data makes it a core
infrastructure component for trading, risk management, and fraud detection.
Financial institutions use Kafka to stream data from market data feeds,
transaction data, and other external sources to drive decisions.

A common data pipeline to ingest and store financial data involves publishing
real-time data to Kafka and utilizing Kafka Connect to stream that to databases.
For example, the market data team may continuously update real-time quotes for a
security to Kafka, and the trading team may consume that data to make buy/sell
orders. Processed market data and orders may then be saved to a time series
database for further analysis.

In this article, we'll create a sample data pipeline to illustrate how this
could work in practice. We will poll an external data source (FinnHub) for
real-time quotes of stocks and ETFs, and publish that information to Kafka.
Kafka Connect will then grab those records and publish it to a time series
database (QuestDB) for analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker Engine: 20.10+
- [Golang 1.19+](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [FinnHub API Token](https://finnhub.io/)

## Setup

To run the example locally, first clone the
[repo](https://github.com/Yitaek/stocks-kafka-questdb)

The codebase is organized into three parts:

- Golang code is located at the root of the repo
- Dockerfile for the Kafka Connect QuestDB image and the Docker Compose YAML
  file is under docker
- JSON files for Kafka Connect sinks are under `kafka-connect-sinks`

## Building the Kafka Connect QuestDB Image

We first need to build the Kafka Connect docker image with QuestDB Sink
connector. Navigate to the `docker` directory and run `docker-compose build`.

The Dockerfile is simply installing the
[Kafka QuestDB Connector via Confluent Hub](https://www.confluent.io/hub/questdb/kafka-questdb-connector)
on top of the Confluent Kafka Connect base image:

```shell
FROM confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect-base:7.3.2\
RUN confluent-hub install --no-prompt questdb/kafka-questdb-connector:0.6
```

## Start Kafka, Kafka Connect, QuestDB

Next, we will set up the infrastructure via Docker Compose. From the same
`docker` directory, run Docker Compose in the background:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start Kafka + Zookeeper, our custom Kafka Connect image with the
QuestDB Connector installed, as well as QuestDB. The full content of the Docker
Compose file is as follows:

```yaml

```

## Start the QuestDB Kafka Connect Sink

Wait for the Docker containers to be healthy (the kafka-connect image will log
"Finished starting connectors and tasks" message), and we can create our Kafka
Connect sinks. We will create two sinks: one for Tesla and one for SPY (SPDR S&P
500 ETF) to compare price trends of a volatile stock and the overall market.

Issue the following curl command to create the Tesla sink within the
`kafka-connect-sinks` directory:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data @questdb-sink-TSLA.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

The JSON file it posts contains the following configurations.

```json
{
  "name": "questdb-sink-SPY",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.questdb.kafka.QuestDBSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "topics": "topic_SPY",
    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
    "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
    "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
    "host": "questdb",
    "timestamp.field.name": "timestamp"
  }
}
```

Create the sink for SPY as well:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data @questdb-sink-SPY.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

## Streaming real-time stock quotes with Apache Kafka and QuestDB

Now that we have our data pipeline set up, we are ready to stream real time
stock quotes to Kafka and store them in QuestDB.

First, we need to get a free API token from Finnhub Stock API. Create a
[free account online](https://finnhub.io/register) and copy the API key.

Export that key to our shell under `FINNHUB_TOKEN`:

```shell
export FINNHUB_TOKEN=<my-token-here>
```

The [realtime quote endpoint](https://finnhub.io/docs/api/quote) returns various
attributes such as the current price, high/low/open quotes, as well as previous
close price. Since we are just interested in the current price, we only grab the
price and add the ticket symbol and timestamp to the Kafka JSON message.

The code below will grab the quote every 30 seconds and publish to the Kafka
topic: `topic_TSLA `.

```Golang
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go/v2/kafka"
)

type StockData struct {
	Price float64 `json:"c"`
}

type StockDataWithTime struct {
	Symbol    string  `json:"symbol"`
	Price     float64 `json:"price"`
	Timestamp int64   `json:"timestamp"`
}

func main() {
	// Create a new Kafka producer instance
	p, err := kafka.NewProducer(&kafka.ConfigMap{"bootstrap.servers": "localhost:9092"})
	if err != nil {
		panic(fmt.Sprintf("Failed to create producer: %s\n", err))
	}
	defer p.Close()

	for {
		token, found := os.LookupEnv("FINNHUB_TOKEN")
		if !found {
			panic("FINNHUB_TOKEN is undefined")
		}
		symbol := "TSLA"

		url := fmt.Sprintf("https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=%s&token=%s", symbol, token)

		// Retrieve the stock data
		resp, err := http.Get(url)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			return
		}
		defer resp.Body.Close()

		// Read the response body
		body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			return
		}

		// Unmarshal the JSON data into a struct
		var data StockData
		err = json.Unmarshal(body, &data)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			return
		}

		// Format data with timestamp
		tsData := StockDataWithTime{
			Symbol:    symbol,
			Price:     data.Price,
			Timestamp: time.Now().UnixNano() / 1000000,
		}

		jsonData, err := json.Marshal(tsData)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			return
		}

		topic := fmt.Sprintf("topic_%s", symbol)
		err = p.Produce(&kafka.Message{
			TopicPartition: kafka.TopicPartition{Topic: &topic, Partition: kafka.PartitionAny},
			Value:          jsonData,
		}, nil)

		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Failed to produce message: %s\n", err)
		}

		fmt.Printf("Message published to Kafka: %s", string(jsonData))

		time.Sleep(30 * time.Second)
	}
}
```

To start streaming the data, run the code:

```shell
\$ go run main.go
```

To also get data for SPY, open up another terminal window, modify the code for
the symbol to SPY and run the code as well with the token value set.

### Result

After running the producer code, it will print out messages that it sends to
Kafka like:
`Message published to Kafka: {"symbol":"TSLA","price":174.48,"timestamp":1678743220215}` .
This data is sent to the Kafka topic topic_TSLA and sent to QuestDB via the
Kafka Connect sink.

We can then navigate to `localhost:9000` to access the QuestDB console.
Searching for all records in the topic_TSLA table, we can see our real-time
market quotes:

```questdb-sql
SELECT * FROM 'topic_TSLA'
```

![Screenshot of the result ot the SELECT * FROM 'topic_TSLA' statement](/img/blog/2023-03-31/tsla.png)

We can also look at SPY data from `topic_SPY`:

```questdb-sql
SELECT * FROM 'topic_SPY'
```

![Screenshot of the result ot the SELECT * FROM 'topic_SPY' statement](/img/blog/2023-03-31/spy.png)

With the data now in QuestDB, we can query for aggregate information by getting
the average price over 2m window:

```questdb-sql
SELECT avg(price), timestamp FROM topic_SPY SAMPLE BY 2m;
```

## Conclusion

Kafka is a trusted component of data pipelines handling large amounts of time
series data such as financial data. Kafka can be used to stream mission-critical
source data to multiple destinations, including time series databases suited for
real-time analytics.

In this article, we created a reference implementation of how to poll real-time
market data and use Kafka to stream that to QuestDB via Kafka Connect. For more
information on the QuestDB Kafka connector, check out the overview page on the
[QuestDB website](https://questdb.io/docs/third-party-tools/kafka/questdb-kafka/).
It lists more information on the configuration details and FAQs on setting it
up. The
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/questdb/kafka-questdb-connector/tree/main/kafka-questdb-connector-samples)
for the connector also has sample projects including a Node.js and a Java
example for those looking to extend this reference architecture.
