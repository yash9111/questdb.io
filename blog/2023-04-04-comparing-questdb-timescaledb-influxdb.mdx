## Why time-series databases are popular

We're living in
[the golden age of databases](https://www.protocol.com/manuals/the-new-database/golden-age-databases-last),
as money flows into the industry at historical rates (e.g.,
[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/),
[Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/), [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)).
The last decade saw an explosion of purpose-built databases designed for use
cases in which a conventional RDBMS might not be the best fit. According to
[DB-Engines](https://db-engines.com/en/), an initiative to collect and present
information on database management systems, time-series databases have been one
of the fastest growing technologies in the past few years:

### Why use a time-series database?

Time-series databases (TSDB) are databases optimized to ingest, process, and
store timestamped data. Such data may include metrics from servers and
applications, readings from IoT sensors, user interaction on a website or an
app, or trading activity on financial markets.

The following properties usually characterize time-series workloads:

- Each data point includes a timestamp used to index, aggregate, and sample. The
  data can also be multi-dimensional and correlated.
- High write speed (ingestion) is preferred to capture data at high frequencies.
- Summarized view of the data (e.g., downsampled or aggregated view, trend
  lines) may provide more insight than a single data point. For example, given
  network unreliability or outliers in sensor readings, we may set alerts when
  some average value over time exceeds a threshold rather than doing so on a
  single data point.
- Analyzing the data usually requires accessing it over some window of time
  (e.g., give me the click rate data over the past week).

While other databases can also handle time-series data to a certain extent,
TSDBs are designed with the above properties to handle data ingestion, storage,
and aggregation over time more efficiently. So as the demand for time series
data continues to explode on the heels of cloud computing, IoT, financial market
data, and machine learning, how should architects go about choosing a time-series database?

## InfluxDB

First released in 2013, InfluxDB is the market leader in the TSDB space,
overtaking Graphite and OpenTSDB that came before. As with many OSS database
companies, [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is licensed with MIT License for
a single node, with paid-plans available for InfluxDB Cloud and InfluxDB
enterprise that provide clustering and other production-ready features.

Previously, the InfluxDB Platform consisted of the TICK stack: Telegraf (agent
for collecting and reporting metrics), InfluxDB (the database engine),
Chronograf (web interface to InfluxDB), and Kapacitor (background processing).
Since version 2.x InfluxDB is installed as a single binary that bundles the
database, the UI, and the background processor. If you want to use Telegraf, it
is still supported as a separate binary.

:::note

At the time of this writing (March 2023), InfluxDB offers additional versions
with different query engines and different capabilities. We are referring here
to Open Source InfluxDB 2.6.

:::

To understand how InfluxDB works, we need to grasp the following key concepts:

- **Data model (tagset model)**: Besides the timestamp field, each data element
  consists of various tags (optional, indexed metadata fields), fields (key and
  value), and measurement (container for tags, fields, and timestamps). The
  example below takes census data from bees and ants, collected in Klamath and
  Portland by scientists Anderson and Mullen. Here location and scientist are
  tags, falling under the census measurement with field/value pair for bees and
  ants.

<Screenshot
  alt="An example table created from ingesting data in InfluxDB line protocol"

  src="/img/blog/2023-04-04/influx-schema.png"
  width={770}
  title="Image Credit: Influxdata"
/>

- **Schemaless Design:** InfluxDB does not enforce a schema before ingesting
  data. Instead, the schema is automatically inferred from the tags and fields
  sent over the line protocol. This gives you great flexibility when writing
  your applications. In any case, it is possible to enforce schemas for specific
  buckets if needed.

- **Data storage (TSM & TSI):** data points are stored in time-structured merge
  tree (TSM), and time series index (TSI) files. TSM can be thought of a
  [LSM tree with write-ahead log (WAL) and read-only files similar to SSTables](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.6/reference/internals/storage-engine)
  that are sorted and compressed. In the event of high cardinality (i.e., large
  number of elements in a set), performance can decrease. The proprietary
  InfluxDB Cloud (IOx) claims high cardinality is not an issue anymore.

- **Query languages:** InfluxDB originally supported only InfluxQL, an SQL-like
  language, but in 2018
  [its CTO announced Flux](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/why-were-building-flux-a-new-data-scripting-and-query-language/),
  a domain-specific functional language developed by InfluxDB, which became then
  the recommended language. InfluxDB's decision to create its custom functional
  data scripting language (Flux) presents another layer of complexity to
  mastering this ecosystem. The team at InfluxDB
  [points to two motivations](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/why-were-building-flux-a-new-data-scripting-and-query-language/)
  to move away from SQL-like InfluxQL to Flux. Flux syntax requires some effort
  to adapt, especially if you're looking for simple SQL queries or not looking
  to learn yet another new language. Still considering the large community and
  [integrations](https://www.influxdata.com/products/integrations/) that
  InfluxDB has assembled, some of the advantages of Flux start to materialize,
  especially when combined with built-in dashboards.

  In the latest (non open source) InfluxDB Cloud IOx,
  [SQL is now the preferred language](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud-iox/query-data/flux-sql/).

Overall, InfluxDB is a great choice if the time series data fits nicely with the
tagset model. Their main use case seems to be geared towards
infrastructure/application monitoring, but as the market leader in this space,
InfluxDB also seamlessly integrates with popular data sources.

- **Pros:** schemaless ingestion, huge community, integrations with popular
  tools
- **Cons:** performance decreases on datasets with high-cardinality. Open Source
  version supports a single instance. Multiple versions with different database
  engines, supported languages, and features. New querying language (Flux) to
  learn.

## TimescaleDB

Whereas InfluxDB opted to build a new database and custom language from scratch,
on the other end of the spectrum is [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/).
TimescaleDB is built as an extension on top of PostgreSQL and adds an
intermediary layer called
[hypertables](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/overview/core-concepts/hypertables-and-chunks/)
that chunks data into multiple underlying tables while abstracting it as a
single, large table for interacting with the data.

<Screenshot

  width={770}
  title="Image Credit: TimescaleDB"
/>

PostgreSQL compatibility is TimescaleDB's biggest selling point. TimescaleDB
fully supports all of the SQL features (e.g., joins, secondary and partial
indexes) as well as popular extensions like [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/).
More importantly, TimescaleDB inherits decades of knowledge from both developers
running SQL queries as well as database and sysadmins running PostgreSQL at
scale. Since TimescaleDB is just a PostgreSQL extension, cloud-managed options
(e.g.
[Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/timescaledb-for-azure-database-for-postgresql-to-power-iot-and-time-series-workloads/),
[Aiven](https://help.aiven.io/en/articles/1752157-getting-started-with-timescaledb-in-aiven-for-postgresql))
aside from TimescaleDB's own managed offering are readily available, not to
mention the self-managed options on VMs or containers.

Because TimescaleDB began as an IoT platform, where they used InfluxDB at first,
to store their sensor data, its features bode well for IoT time series data
which is often 'bursty', frequently out of order due to network unreliability,
and characterized by high cardinality:

- **Hypertables:** Time-series functionality offerred by TimescaleDB cannot be
  used on regular PostgreSQL tables. TimescaleDB introduces the concept of a
  hypertable instead. Even if the user experience is similar to a regular table,
  hypertables have more complexity behind the scenes. TimescaleDB
  [partitions its hypertables into chunks](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/overview/core-concepts/hypertables-and-chunks/#partitioning-in-hypertables-with-chunks)
  based on a time column as well as other "spatial" values such as a device uid,
  location identifier, or a stock symbol. Users can configure these chunks to
  hold the most recent data in memory, asynchronously compress and re-order data
  by the time column to disk (instead of ingestion time), and replicate or
  migrate transactionally across nodes.

- **Continuous Aggregation:** TimescaleDB also supports
  [continuous aggregation of data](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/overview/core-concepts/continuous-aggregates/)
  to make computing key metrics like hourly average, minimum, and maximum values
  fast. Behind the scenes, the data is stored using PostgreSQL materialized
  views; additional storage is needed as a trade-off for faster queries. For
  time-based aggregations (e.g., average temperature between 3 pm and 4 pm vs.
  the exact temperature at 3 pm), scanning fewer data for each aggregation can
  help performance-wise.

- **Data Retention:** Large deletes are a costly operation in traditional
  relational databases. However, since TimescaleDB stores data in chunks, it
  [provides a `drop_chunks` feature](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/overview/core-concepts/data-retention/#data-retention)
  to quickly drop old data without the same overhead. Since the relevance of old
  data diminishes over time, TimescaleDB can be used to move older data to save
  disk space.



Overall, TimescaleDB is a good fit for teams looking for a
performance boost without heavy refactoring to migrate off their existing SQL
databases. Even though TimescaleDB is still relatively new (first release in
2017), the decision to build on top of PostgreSQL has boosted its adoption
numbers to reach the top 5 TSDBs. 

One drawback is the lack of a streaming ingestion protocol like the InfluxDB Line Protocol.
This makes ingestion less flexible and less focused on performance as a result.

- **Pros:** PostgreSQL-compatibility, scales well with data cardinality, various
  deployment models available.
- **Cons:** enforced schema (might add a bit of complexity and data
  transformation effort before ingestion), extra storage needed for continuous
  aggregations, lack of streaming ingestion protocol.

## QuestDB

For those looking to take advantage of the flexibility of InfluxDB line protocol
and the familiarity of PostgreSQL, a younger time series database may satisfy
both requirements without sacrificing performance. QuestDB (YC S20) is an
open-source TSDB written in low-lantency Java, C++, and Rust. It ranks in \#10
on
[DB-Engines Time Series DBMS](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/time+series+dbms),
although it officially
[launched less than three years ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23975807).
Alongside the Apache 2.0 licensed project, QuestDB also offers a fully managed
[Cloud offering](https://questdb.io/cloud/), and
[a commercial Enterprise version](https://questdb.io/enterprise/). QuestDB
implements a highly optimized
[column-based storage model](/docs/concept/storage-model). The data is sorted by
time natively and stored in time partitions. Those partitions are append-only
and versioned. QuestDB only lifts the latest version of the partition in memory
for any given time-based query. As such, queries do not slow down as more data
is being ingested.

<Screenshot

  width={770}
/>

By building the database engine from scratch, the QuestDB team focused on three
things:

- **Performance:** Solving the ingestion bottleneck with high throughput
  ingestion, for datasets of all sizes. QuestDB addresses one of the pain points
  of InfluxDB, with its ability to handle high cardinality datasets. To speed up
  queries, QuestDB leverages modern hardware with SIMD instructions, aggregating
  multiple rows simultaneously. The engineering team built
  [a JIT compiler](/docs/concept/jit-compiler/) designed to parallelize query
  filters during execution. QuestDB stores data in time partitions; this reduces
  the volume of data which has to fit in memory for reads. Finally, the database
  is column based and can handle a high degree of parallelism, slicing and
  processing columns in parallel by all available threads.

- **Compatibility:** QuestDB supports InfluxDB line protocol, PostgreSQL wire,
  REST API and CSV upload to ingest data. Users accustomed to other time-series databases
  can easily port over their existing applications without a significant rewrite,
  and users can choose amongst a set of ingestion protocols depending on their
  use cases. There are client libraries in multiple languages for the InfluxDB
  Line Protocol.

- **Querying via SQL:** Despite supporting multiple ingestion mechanisms,
  QuestDB uses SQL as the query language, so there's no need to learn a
  domain-specific language like Flux. Additionally, there are
  time-series-specific [SQL extensions](https://questdb.io/blog/2022/11/23/sql-extensions-time-series-data-questdb-part-ii/)
  to handle time-series data with ease.

In terms of performance, QuestDB
[recently posted some benchmark results](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/tag/7.0.1)
with an ingestion rate reaching 4.3 million rows per second. This was computed
through the [TSBS benchmark](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs), currently
maintained by TimescaleDB, selecting the `cpu-only` use case. The chosen
instance had 32 CPUs and 64GB of RAM.

  width={770}
  title="Benchmark results for QuestDB 7.0, InfluxDB 1.8 and Timescale 2.10"
/>

The other interesting component of QuestDB is support for both InfluxDB Line
Protocol and PostgreSQL wire for ingestion. For existing InfluxDB users, you can
configure Telegraf to point to QuestDB's address and port. PostgreSQL users can
leverage their client libraries or JDBC to write data into QuestDB. Regardless
of the ingestion method, data can be queried using standard SQL with notable
exceptions listed on the API reference page.

Even though a single QuestDB instance can handle multi-billion row datasets, one
of its shortcomings at the time of writing is the lack of replication, which
will be available to open source users
[soon](https://github.com/orgs/questdb/projects/1/views/5). When it comes to
third party integrations, QuestDB integrates with some of the most popular tools
(e.g., PostgreSQL, Grafana, Pandas, Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, MindsDB, Telegraf, Kubernetes...).
There are more integrations underway, such as more dashboards / BI tools.

- **Pros:** fast ingestion, better performance using fewer resources, support
  for both InfluxDB protocol and PostgreSQL wire, querying via standard SQL,
  optimized queries with SIMD, open source and fully managed QuestDB versions
  available.
- **Cons:** smaller community, reduced number of available integrations,
  replication still under development.

## Conclusion

As the demand for time series data continues to grow, time-series databases
specialized to deal with this data will see massive adoption and fierce competition. 
Besides the three open-source TSDBs covered in this article, there are also public cloud
offerings from AWS (AWS Timestream) and Azure (Azure Series Insights).

As with all databases, choosing the "perfect" time-series database depends primarily on 
your business requirements, data model, and use case. InfluxDB works well if your
data fits the Tagset model with a rich ecosystem of integrations readily
available. TimescaleDB is a natural fit for existing PostgreSQL users. Finally,
if performance is the primary concern, QuestDB is a popular and
developer-friendly database that is growing rapidly.
