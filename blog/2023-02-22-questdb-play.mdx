We built `play` for anyone to try our database in a very easy way. There’s a
Jupyter Lab notebook, data, sample code, queries, and graphs. The data is grid
energy usage and forecasts at 15-minute intervals. You’ll be able to play with
just under half a million rows, try out queries and plot a few graphs.
