Welcome to another post on SQL performance tuning! Previously, in
[EXPLAIN Your SQL Query Plan](/blog/explain-sql-query-plan/), we learned how to
use [EXPLAIN](/docs/reference/sql/explain/) to check the estimated execution
plan of a query. This time we'll focus on the basic methods the QuestDB SQL
engine uses to read data - scan nodes.

So, what is a scan node?

A scan node is a query execution plan node responsible for fetching data
according to an algorithm.

Imagine binary search on sorted data but with partitions, indexes, and column
data files instead of arrays.

Most databases refer to scan nodes using custom terms, like "operations" or
"select types", while in literature, it's usually "access methods".

The QuestDB SQL engine uses the following scan nodes:

- Frame scan
- Interval scan
- Index scan
  - Index scan in table order
  - Index scan in index order

All of the above support both forward and backward scanning.

Any non-trivial query is bound to use one of these, so as with traditional CS
algorithms, it makes sense to learn about their characteristics to write more
optimized SQL queries.

All the examples in this article use tables available in the
[QuestDB demo instance](https://demo.questdb.io/).

The following is the schema for the table `trades`:

```questdb-sql
CREATE TABLE trades (
 symbol SYMBOL,
 side SYMBOL,
 price DOUBLE,
 amount DOUBLE,
 timestamp TIMESTAMP
) timestamp (timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY WAL;
```

## Frame scan

<Banner
  alt="Frame scan."
  height={433}
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-25/frame_scan.svg"
  width={650}
/>

Frame scan, also known as Full Table Scan, reads all table rows. With QuestDB's
column-based storage model, the amount of data to read depends on the columns
used in the query.

A query selecting all columns amounts to a traditional Full Table Scan. A query
selecting a single/a few columns from a wide table might read just a few percent
of the table's data.

Frame forward scans start at the first row of the oldest partition (the one with
the lowest timestamp partition key value) and stop at the last row of the latest
one (the one with the highest timestamp partition key value). Differentiating
between forward and backward scans only makes sense for tables with a designated
timestamp because they store data in that timestamp order. For tables without
designated timestamps, the scan direction is not vital for query performance
tuning because there's no predictable order to data.

Let's look at a simple `SELECT` statement:

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT * FROM trades
ORDER BY timestamp;
```

| QUERY PLAN                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |
| DataFrame                                             |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row forward scan              |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frame forward scan on: trades |

In the `EXPLAIN` output, the forward scan is represented on the table level as
`Frame forward scan`, and on the partition level as `Row forward scan`.

Why not just `Seq Scan` like in PostgreSQL?

It might seem verbose to show a simple table scan with so many plan nodes, but
there's a reason for that.

QuestDB is optimized to work with large time-series data sets stored in
time-partitioned tables, often with tens or hundreds of partitions. If we were
to follow PostgreSQL's approach of showing all partitions, for instance:

```
EXPLAIN
SELECT *
FROM trades
WHERE timestamp < now();
```

we would get:

| QUERY PLAN                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Append (cost=0.00..176.00 rows=2720 width=12)                             |
| -> Seq Scan on trades_y2006 trades_1 (cost=0.00..40.60 rows=680 width=12) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter: (ts < now())            |
| -> Seq Scan on trades_y2007 trades_2 (cost=0.00..40.60 rows=680 width=12) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter: (ts < now())            |
| ...                                                                       |

This output would take too much space.

Therefore, QuestDB's EXPLAIN command shows:

- The direction of Data Frame (a piece or the whole partition) iteration, e.g.
  `Frame forward scan`
- The direction of Row iteration within a Data Frame, e.g. `Row forward scan`
- A list of scan boundaries in `Interval scan`, e.g.:

  `intervals: [("1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z","1970-01-01T23:59:59.999999Z")]`

Opposite to Frame forward scans, Frame backward scans read all table rows from
the latest partition and finish at the oldest partition.

Take another exaple:

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT * FROM trades
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

| QUERY PLAN                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| DataFrame                                              |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row backward scan              |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frame backward scan on: trades |

The query optimizer implements `ORDER BY` with a backward scan. If you run the
same query on a table without the designated timestamp, unsurprisingly, you'll
get:

| QUERY PLAN                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sort light                                                                     |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;keys: [timestamp desc]                                             |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DataFrame                                              |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row backward scan              |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frame backward scan on: trades |

Sorting is required here because the data is in an unknown order.

### Interval scan

<Banner
  alt="Interval forward scan."
  height={433}
  src="/img/blog/2023-04-25/interval_scan.svg"
  width={650}
/>

In addition to the more common Frame scans, QuestDB implements a more optimized
type of table scan for queries with a condition on the designated timestamp. We
call this "interval scan". The QuestDB engine analyzes the condition, extracts a
list of timestamp intervals, and then for each interval, it binary searches scan
boundaries in the designated timestamp column, for instance:

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT * FROM trades
WHERE timestamp IN '2023-01-20';
```

| QUERY PLAN                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DataFrame                                                                                                      |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row forward scan                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interval forward scan on: trades                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intervals: [("2023-01-20T00:00:00.000000Z","2023-01-20T23:59:59.999999Z")] |

As the plan shows, the query optimizer reduces scanning to a single interval,
the `2023-01-20` day partition.

The engine might even detect conflicting conditions and not run any scan at all,
e.g.:

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT * FROM trades
WHERE timestamp in '2023-01-20'
AND timestamp < '2022-01-01';
```

| QUERY PLAN  |
| ----------- |
| Empty table |

If the condition is too complex (especially if the query uses the designated
timestamp as a function argument), the engine will fall back to the default
table scan with a filter, e.g.:

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT * FROM trades
WHERE dateadd('m', 1, timestamp) in '2023-01-20';
```

| QUERY PLAN                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Async Filter                                                                        |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;filter: dateadd('m',1,timestamp) in [1674172800000000,1674259199999999] |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;workers: 24                                                             |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DataFrame                                                   |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row forward scan                    |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frame forward scan on: trades       |

Rewriting the `WHERE` condition to the below makes the query use the interval
scan:

```questdb-sql
timestamp BETWEEN '2023-01-19T23:59:00.000000Z' AND '2023-01-20T23:59:00.000000Z'
```

Similarly to Frame scans, QuestDB also supports Interval backward scans. They
run in the reverse order from their forward counterpart: from the last row of
the last interval to the first row of the first interval. The scan node can be
used to implement descending timestamp order without the need to sort:

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT * FROM trades
WHERE timestamp in '2023-01-20'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

| QUERY PLAN                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DataFrame                                                                                                      |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row backward scan                                                                      |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interval backward scan on: trades                                                      |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intervals: [("2023-01-20T00:00:00.000000Z","2023-01-20T23:59:59.999999Z")] |

## Index scan

In contrast to Frame and Interval scans, which access table data directly, index
scans first scan an [index](/docs/concept/indexes/) and then use the result
values - row ids - to access relevant table rows. Another difference is that
index scans are performed separately for each partition or interval used by a
query. That's why it appears in the same `EXPLAIN` output location as e.g.
`Row forward scan`.

The `trades` table doesn't have any index, so let's switch to another demo
table, `pos`, with the following schema:

```questdb-sql
CREATE TABLE pos (
 time TIMESTAMP,
 id SYMBOL INDEX,
 lat DOUBLE,
 lon DOUBLE,
 geo6 GEOHASH(6c),
 geo12 GEOHASH(12c)
) timestamp (time) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

### Index scan with a single key

<Banner

src="/img/blog/2023-04-25/index_scan.svg"
width={650}
>
Index forward scan: scanning from (1) to (6)

Index backward scan: scanning from (6) to (1)
</Banner>


For any given index key, row ids are stored in table order, which is the same as
timestamp order for tables with the designated timestamp. It means that when
querying for a single index key, the ordering can be implemented with the scan
direction alone without the need for sorting:

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM pos WHERE id in ('X');
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM pos WHERE id in ('X') ORDER BY time;
```

The queries above produce the same plan:

| QUERY PLAN                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DeferredSingleSymbolFilterDataFrame                              |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index forward scan on: id deferred: true |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: id='X'               |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frame forward scan on: pos               |

Note - `deferred: true` means that `symbol` is not found in the `symbol`
dictionary, so the resolution was delayed until the query run time.

What if we switch the `ORDER BY` direction and add a condition on the timestamp?

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT * FROM pos
WHERE id in ('X')
AND time in '2023-02-01'
ORDER BY id, time DESC;
```

This yields:

| QUERY PLAN                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DeferredSingleSymbolFilterDataFrame                                                                            |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index backward scan on: id deferred: true                                              |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: id='X'                                                             |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interval forward scan on: pos                                                          |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intervals: [("2023-02-01T00:00:00.000000Z","2023-02-01T23:59:59.999999Z")] |

As you can see, not only is the potential sort replaced by a backward scan, but
the scanning was reduced to a single timestamp interval by combining an Index
scan with an Interval scan.

### Index scan with multiple keys

Things get more interesting when there's more than one index key to scan. As
shown in the index scan diagram above, indexes are partitioned. When QuestDB
iterates over a partition or interval list and conducts an index scan for each
partition or interval, the output is still in timestamp order.

This is not the case for an index scan with multiple key values because table
rows associated with each index key can interleave. Reading all rows associated
with key k1, then k2, etc. could end up jumping randomly over partition data.

We can scan row ids in different orders:

- `Table-order` - scans the minimum row id available from all per-key row ids
  until there's none left.
- `Index-order` - first reads all row ids associated with key k1, then k2, and
  so on.

#### Table order

  Index backward scan in table order: scanning from (6) to (1)
</Banner>

Index scans with multiple keys in table order read all row ids associated in
table (or physical) order. It means that memory and disk access is as sequential
as possible, which is a good default approach. This scan node is comparable to
PostgreSQL's Bitmap Heap Scan.

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT * FROM pos
WHERE id in ('X', 'Y');
```

| QUERY PLAN                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FilterOnValues                                                                           |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table-order scan                                                 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index forward scan on: id deferred: true |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: id='X'               |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index forward scan on: id deferred: true |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: id='Y'               |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frame forward scan on: pos                                       |

#### Index order

</Banner>

Index scans with multiple keys in index order scan table rows using row ids
associated with the first index key, followed by those associated with the
second index key, and so on.

The scan continues until reaching the last index value. It might be used to
avoid sorting at the price of potentially more random memory and disk accesses.

```questdb-sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT * FROM pos
WHERE id in ('X', 'Y')
AND time in '2023-02-01'
ORDER BY id,time DESC;
```

| QUERY PLAN                                                                                                     |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursor-order scan                                                                      |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: id='X'                                     |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index backward scan on: id deferred: true                      |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: id='Y'                                     |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interval forward scan on: pos                                                          |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intervals: [("2023-02-01T00:00:00.000000Z","2023-02-01T23:59:59.999999Z")] |

It may look like we're mixing Frame (`Interval forward scan`) and in-Frame
(`Index backward scan`) scan directions, but in fact, it doesn't matter because
there's just one partition to scan. While this makes sense with a single
partition, with multiple partitions it would require sorting. That's because
combining the results of Index scans for each partition is not guaranteed to
produce the required order.

Without sorting, the output could look like the following:

| time                        | id  | ... |
| --------------------------- | --- | --- |
| 2023-02-01T01:00:00.000000Z | X   |     |
| 2023-02-01T02:00:00.000000Z | X   |     |
| 2023-02-01T01:00:00.000000Z | Y   |     |
| 2023-02-02T01:00:00.000000Z | X   |     |
| 2023-02-02T02:00:00.000000Z | Y   |     |
| ...                         |     |     |

## More in-depth examples

Now that we've learned the basics, let's dig a bit deeper.

The Frame scan is commonly known as the Full Table Scan. That's because scanning
a table might have to, in the pessimistic case, read all table rows. For certain
queries, however, it might be fine to read just a handful of rows. For example,
say we need to count the number of rows in the `trades` table:

```questdb-sql
SELECT count(*) FROM trades;
```

it returns 1634599313 in just 240μs.

Is the response time right? According to the execution plan:

| QUERY PLAN                                                                    |

It should be doing a full table scan, but the response time is way too fast for
this to be possible. Reading all timestamp values, that is about 12GB of memory,
in 240μs would require 50TB/s bandwidth, way higher than the 'lousy' 20GB/s
available on the demo instance. What actually happens?

If possible, instead of iterating over all records, the `Count` plan node
iterates over partitions and sums the number of rows in each using partition
metadata. This optimization only makes sense in the absence of the `WHERE`
conditions.

For comparison, the following query has to evaluate the condition for each table
row, and even with parallel execution, it still takes about 7 seconds to
complete:

```questdb-sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM trips
WHERE total_amount > 0;
```

Now, let's check if any of the trips finish at a specific location. A simple way
to phrase it is:

```questdb-sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM trips
WHERE dropoff_location_id = 110;
```

The query returns in 120 ms, which is nice, but can we make it faster? Since
we're only interested in knowing if any trip meets the criteria, we don't really
need the exact count. Instead, we can find the first matching row and stop:

```questdb-sql
SELECT count(*) FROM
(
  SELECT *
  FROM trips
  WHERE dropoff_location_id = 110
  LIMIT 1
);
```

This time, the query returns in 90 ms, which means that the first row is away
from the start of the table, and the engine has to scan more than half of the
table. What if we do a backward scan from the end? How 'full' would the scan be
then? Would it be half full or half empty?

```questdb-sql
SELECT count(*) FROM
(
  SELECT *
  FROM trips
  WHERE dropoff_location_id = 110
  ORDER BY pickup_datetime DESC
  LIMIT 1
);
```

It turns out that it's not full at all! The result comes ~ 12 times faster, in
10 ms. It makes sense because the designated timestamp value of the matching row
is `2019-05-21T20:51:26.000000Z`, very close to the maximum in the table -
`2019-06-30T23:59:56.000000Z`.

Let's check the execution plan:

| QUERY PLAN                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Count                                                                         |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Async JIT Filter                                      |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;limit: 1                                  |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: dropoff_location_id=110           |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workers: 24                               |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DataFrame                     |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row backward scan             |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frame backward scan on: trips |

As expected, the query does a backward scan (`Frame backward scan`) and stops on
the first matching row ( `limit: 1` under `Async JIT Filter`).

Remember that the approach above only makes sense if the data is close to the
end of the table; otherwise, it might slow things down.

## Using `EXPLAIN` to optimize your SQL queries

We have introduced the basic scan nodes available in QuestDB:

- Frame scan
- Interval scan
- Index scan (in table and index order)

Peeking under the database's hood with `EXPLAIN`, we have also demonstrated some
of the available optimizations for tables with the designated timestamp. Knowing
how data is accessed, we were able to optimize queries by reducing the volume of
read data.

In the examples above, we have learned methods such as:

- Limiting the number of columns accessed
- Reducing table scanning by adding conditions on the designated timestamp
- Reducing table scanning with `LIMIT` and/or changing the scan direction
- Accessing records via the index

Feel free to try out examples on the
[QuestDB demo instance](https://demo.questdb.io/). We hope you enjoy this
tutorial.

Happy query tuning!
