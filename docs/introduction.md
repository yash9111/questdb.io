<!-- TODO: update summary -->

QuestDB is a relational column-oriented database designed for time series and
event data. It uses SQL with extensions for time series to assist with real-time
analytics. These pages cover core concepts of QuestDB, including setup steps,
usage guides, and reference documentation for syntax, APIs and configuration.

## Concepts

This section describes the architecture of QuestDB, how it stores and queries
data, and introduces features and capabilities unique to the system.

- [Designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp/) is a core feature
  that enables time-oriented language capabilities and partitioning
- [Symbol](/docs/concept/symbol/) type makes storing and retrieving repetitive
  strings efficient
- [Storage model](/docs/concept/storage-model/) describes how QuestDB stores
  records and partitions within tables
- [Indexes](/docs/concept/indexes/) can be used for faster read access on
  specific columns
- [Partitions](/docs/concept/partitions/) can be used for significant
  performance benefits on calculations and queries
- [SQL extensions](/docs/concept/sql-extensions/) allow performant time series
  analysis with a concise syntax
- [Root directory](/docs/concept/root-directory-structure/) describes the
  directory contents of QuestDB for storage and configuration

## Install

This section explains how to install and run QuestDB using one of the following
methods:

- [Docker](/docs/install/docker/) for repeatable, portable and scalable
  installations
- [Binaries](/docs/install/binaries/) for direct downloads to run on Linux,
  macOS or Windows
- [Homebrew](/docs/install/homebrew/) for running QuestDB on macOS

## Connect

This section describes how to connect to QuestDB using a variety of tools and
programming languages through our various network endpoints.

- [Network Endpoints Overview](/docs/connect/overview)
- [Web Console](/docs/connect/web-console) for quick SQL queries, charting and CVS functionality.
- [InfluxDB Line Protocol](/docs/connect/ilp) for high performance data insertion.
- [HTTP REST API](/docs/connect/rest) for SQL queries and CSV functionality.
- [PostgreSQL Protocol](/docs/connect/postgres) for compatibility with a wide number of tools and libraries.

## Guides

## Third-party tools

This section describes how to integrate QuestDB with third-party tools and
utilities for collecting metrics and visualizing data:

- [Grafana](/docs/third-party-tools/grafana/) instructions for connecting
  QuestDB as a datasource for building visualizations and dashboards
- [Kafka](/docs/third-party-tools/kafka/) guide for ingesting data from topics
  into QuestDB by means of Kafka Connect
- [Telegraf](/docs/third-party-tools/telegraf/) guide for collecting system
  metrics, specifying QuestDB as an output and visualizing the results

## Operations

This section contains resources for managing QuestDB instances and has dedicated
pages for the following topics:

- [Capacity planning](/docs/operations/capacity-planning/) for configuring
  server settings and system resources for common scenarios and edge cases
- [Data retention](/docs/operations/data-retention/) strategy to delete old data
  and save disk space
- [Health monitoring](/docs/operations/health-monitoring/) endpoint for
  determining the status of the instance
